## Quickstart

The _Historical Social Conflict Database_ (HiSCoD) is a project designed to provide academic researcher and general public with a set of resources for analysing social conflict from the late Middle Ages to the 19th century. To this end, we draw on existing, but sometimes hardly accessible, data set and historical research to collect and harmonise information on the occurence of social conflict in the past. We also conduct original research in the archives to uncover and document new episodes of social conflict. As of March 2022, the _Historical Social Conflict Database_ contains more than 20,000 unique obserbations scattered through more than 25 countries.


## Contribute

By participating in HiSCoD you'll be helping advance research in social sciences and humanities. Data about historical social conflict are vital for scholars to improve our knowledge on the resilience of society facing shocks, such as wars and natural disasters. Social conflict is also an important componant in the study of the construction of modern-day state as well as the emergence of new cultural norms and ideals.

HiSCoD volunteers can contribute to the project by identifying new sources, transcribing documents and/or providing corrections on existing forms. We seek your help because our knowledge and language skills are inherently limited, thus preemptying the discovery of many new episodes of social conflict.

One can use either the [https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/online-form-hiscod](online form) (available in English and French) or the csv template available in this repository to collect and share data with us.
